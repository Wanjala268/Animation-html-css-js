# Animations

This is  a simple animation of a circle moving 
around a square. The circle's position is updated every frame,


##  Step 1: Import necessary libraries
We need to import the necessary libraries for creating the animation. We will use the `matplotlib` library

##  Step 2: Define the animation function
The animation function will be responsible for updating the position of the circle every frame.

##   3: Define the animation parameters
We need to define the parameters of the animation, such as the size of the square, the radius
of the circle, the speed of the circle, and the number of frames.

##   4: Create the animation
We will use the `matplotlib.animation` module to create the animation.

##    5: Display the animation
We will use the `plt.show()` function to display the animation.

##     6: Save the animation
We will use the `ani.save()` function to save the animation as a file.

##      7: Close the animation

We will use the `plt.close()` function to close the animation.

##  Step 8: Run the animation
We will use the `plt.show()` function to run the animation.

##   Step 9: Save the animation as a file
We will use the `ani.save()` function to save the animation as a file.
